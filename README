When hosting map tiles, you get lots of log files of the areas people view your maps. This set of scripts simplify the process of getting log files hosted in an S3 bucket and importing them into a PostGRES database. Then running a tileserver that generates coordinates for the viewed tiles which are rendered in canvas in the browser.
